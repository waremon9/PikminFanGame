# PikminFanGame
At first, a little training at java ihm and it ended being a pikmin fan game.

It's a pikmin game using only the enemy, elements of pikmin. I own no image. It's all shamelessly stolen with the help of google image.

Nothing move, it's just text and some image. The game is not balanced at all.
I was at first inspired by the Pikicord (discord game bot) made by Jimble even though its a lot different from it now.

the .rar version are just what i send to a friend who played the game (good feedback, thanks for playing Bastien). So some of the line in the readme (inside the .rar) are just to explain some things to him. don't mind them.
